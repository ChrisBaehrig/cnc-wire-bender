# cnc-wire-bender
Open Source Project by ChrisBaehrig for a cnc controlled wire bender based on an arduino and cad fusion360 file

## Concept and changes 
The Hardware bases on the Idea of Pensas diwire bender (https://code.google.com/archive/p/diwire/) and the Project from HowtoMechatronics Wire Bender (https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-3d-wire-bending-machine/). 
Power electronic ist improved to for more durability and stronger wires. 
Software ist improved for the end to end production from the cad tool fusion 360 until the cnc wire bending
